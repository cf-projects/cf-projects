Greetings! I am Clark. Recently I was a Customer Succcess Manager in the SaaS industry. 
  After working closely with a Product Development team, I decided to take some time away to teach myself Python full time. 
  I'm interested in automating common business practices as well as increasing adminsitrative efficiencies. 
  Python attracted my attention as I enjoy business analysis and data collection/processing practices. 
  My past experience is mainly in the HR and Finance industries, but I have worked closely with biopharma and science research teams as well.
